## What is the gap?
- Certain charges aren't associated with an account
- On shared platform, costs were unfairly allocated
- Unfair cost burden on SaaS owners
- Teams don't have visibility over their cost
- Wanted to layer in labor costs for maintainence

- Kafka chargeback implemented / only 1 csp in scope
    - Have 8 implemended today
- Data ingested automated
- Process creation for the entire pipeline

## Process Flow
