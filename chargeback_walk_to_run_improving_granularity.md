## What is the gap?
- Certain charges aren't associated with an account
- On shared platform, costs were unfairly allocated
- Unfair cost burden on SaaS owners
- Teams don't have visibility over their cost
- Wanted to layer in labor costs for maintainence

## How chargebacks started
- Kafka chargeback implemented / only 1 csp in scope
    - Have 8 implemended today
- Data ingested automated
- Process creation for the entire pipeline

## Process Flow 
### Prerequisites
- Account creation
    - New resources have tags, cost allocation tags specifically
    - roles and policies (governance)

### Data Ingestion

### Showback/Chargeback

#### Shared Responsibility Model

## Chargeback Models
### Model 1: Even Split
- Shared Cost / Count of Consumers = Consumer Charge
### Model 2: Fixed Percentage
- Shared Cost * Assigned Percentage = Consumer Charge
### Model 3: Metered Usage
- Shared Cost * Consumer % of Metered Usage = Consumer Charge
#### Technical Implementation
#### Showback dashboard

### Model 4: Direct Cost + Proportion of Shared
- Direct Cost + Proportion of Shared Cost = Consumer Charge

#### Technical Implementation/Data Sample
#### Showback Dashboard
