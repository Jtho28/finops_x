# Aligning Duolingo’s Cloud Architecture with Strategic Business Goals

### "In this session, we delve into Duolingo’s innovative approach to FinOps, with a focus on their transformative journey in implementing unit economics and empowering engineers."

### Traditional Opt. vs Eng. Led Opt. 
traditional = rightsizing, RIs

Engineering Led = optimizing largest source of spend and finding why, finding root causes and trends

### KPI as a rosetta stone between finance and engineering
find something thats meaningful to both
Ex. 25k total spend less valuable than $0.25 per transaction

### If you can't allocation, can't manage
ingest -> allocatie -> analyze -> engage
This improves product arch, customer profit, and engineering engagement

## Challenges
cost visibility can be pain 
growth = hard to benchmark costs
missing cost overruns
small team

### operating principles
explicit goals
recognition and incentives -> the most valuable thing is introducing the topic to engineers
correlating user data with billing data
unit economics -> all models are "wrong" BUT some are useful 
leadership monthly reviews - same format (biggest area change, biggest team change, whats happening next)
Train the trainers for these reviews - SREs equipped to prepare and deliver content on monthly reviews

Use Pagerduty.com for reviews!

internal evangelism
- put data to value 
- connection between right decision and celebration

Some processes not up to scale 
Understand unique cultural aspects and double down
provide info and make it easy
