    - Coverage up to 99%
- AWS Recommendations
    - Trusted advisor
    - Compute Optimizer
- Monthly business reviews

## Pivot and Try Again
### Add tech folks into the mix
- Governance gains engineering power
- Finance understands cloud

### One step towards actionabiliy
- Engineers provide technical language in a consumable way for non-endineers

### Thanks, but no thanks
- Conflicting priorities
    - no shared targets
    - features vs optimization
- Trust is not established
    - People don't want other teams telling them what to do

## Try again (++)
### Collaborate with infrastructure teams
- Match engineers with customers to build personal relationships
### Same Team, different focus

## Sensible limits

## Try again on repeat
### Time for long term bets
- Release engineers back to infrastructure
    - They will carry their newly acquired knowledge with them
    - Off load "cloud upkeeping"
- From system to perfomance engineering
    - Create own reccommendations
### Meaningful Optimization
- Engineering excellence
    - REsonates and motivates folks so much better
- Start building and understanding on how to tackle SaaS cost and observabilty
    - We care about using it right
- Most valuable workloads even if they are harder
    - Enabling the autoscaling capabilities and turning down the mins

### Surface information as needed
- Avoid trying to provide everything
### Socialize focus

## Where are they now
- Aligned objectives across teams
- Introduce finops process early on in new projects
### Environment to enable actionability
- Infrastructure now understands cloud economics and which levers to pull
- Product teams design their products with finops in mind
- Reccommendations provide guidance that is easily actionable across the organization

## The road ahead
